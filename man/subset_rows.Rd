\title{Pick a subset of rows, evaluating the subset expression
as if the columns of x were in the evaluation environment.}
\usage{
subset_rows(x, subset, env = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame to work with}

\item{subset}{logical expression to compute per-row}

\item{env}{environment to work in}
}
\value{
data.frame that is the specified subset of the rows of x.
}
\description{
References can be forced to the environment with a .e$ prefix
and forced to the data frame with a .d$ prefix (failure to
lookup returns null). Only works on in-memory data.frames.
