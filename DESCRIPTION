Description:  The 'seplyr' (standard evaluation 'dplyr') package supplies improved
    standard evaluation adapter methods for important common data manipulation tasks.
    In addition the 'seplyr' package supplies several new "key operations
    bound together" methods.  These include 'group_summarize()' (which
    combines grouping, arranging and calculation in an atomic unit),
    'add_group_summaries()' (which joins grouped summaries into a 'data.frame'
    in a well documented manner), 'add_group_indices()' (which adds
    per-group identifiers to a 'data.frame' without depending on row-order),
    'partition_mutate_qt()' (which optimizes mutate sequences), and 'if_else_device()'
    (which simulates per-row if-else blocks in expression sequences).
