Description:     The 'seplyr' (standard evaluation data.frame 'dplyr') package supplies
    standard evaluation adapter methods for important common 'dplyr' methods
    that currently have a non-standard programming interface. This allows
    the analyst to use 'dplyr' to perform fundamental data transformation
    steps such as arranging rows, grouping rows, aggregating selecting
    columns without having to use learn the details of 'rlang'/'tidyeval'
    non-standard evaluation and without continuing to rely on now
    deprecated 'dplyr' "underscore verbs."
    In addition the 'seplyr' package supplies several new "key operations
    bound together" methods.  These include 'group_summarize()' (which
    combines grouping, arranging and calculation in an atomic unit),
    'add_group_summaries()' (which joins grouped summaries into a 'data.frame'
    in a well documented manner), and 'add_group_indices()' (which adds
    per-group identifies to a 'data.frame' without depending on row-order).
